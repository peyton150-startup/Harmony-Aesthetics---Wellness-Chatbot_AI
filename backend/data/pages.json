    "title": "Laser Hair Removal - De|Rive System",
    "content": "Laser hair removal is a medical-grade treatment that uses concentrated light energy to permanently reduce unwanted hair. The De|Rive laser system targets hair follicles with precision, damaging them to slow regrowth and eventually eliminate hair in treated areas. It's a safe, effective, long-term solution to unwanted hair. Laser light is absorbed by melanin pigment in hair follicles, light energy converts to heat damaging the follicle, damaged follicles can't produce new hair, hair falls out over 1-2 weeks post-treatment, multiple sessions needed to catch all hair growth cycles, and results in permanent hair reduction with 80-90% reduction typical. Treatment areas and pricing are Small Areas for $100-150 per session including upper lip, chin, sideburns, underarms, between eyebrows, hairline touch-ups, and individual small zones best for quick touch-ups facial hair and targeted areas. Medium Areas for $200-250 per session including underarms, bikini line standard bikini, Brazilian full bikini, lower face chin plus upper lip combined, hands or feet, neck front or back, and lower abdomen happy trail best for common problem areas and moderate hair coverage. Large Areas for $300-350 per session including full legs upper plus lower, half legs just lower or just upper, full back, full chest, full arms, and shoulders best for extensive coverage and major hair reduction goals. Can combine multiple areas and ask about package pricing for treating several zones. Ideal for adults with unwanted hair, people tired of constant shaving or waxing, those with dark hair which gives best results, anyone seeking long-term hair reduction, people with ingrown hair problems, and those wanting smoother skin without daily maintenance. Works best on dark coarse hair, fair to medium skin tones with dark hair which has highest contrast, and all skin tones with appropriate laser settings. Hair and skin combinations show best results with dark hair on light skin maximum contrast, good results with dark hair on medium skin, moderate results with dark hair on dark skin requiring specific laser, and poor results with light blonde red or gray hair which lacks melanin to absorb energy. Session length varies by treatment area - Small areas 10-20 minutes perfect for lunch breaks, Medium areas 20-40 minutes moderate time commitment comfortable session length, Large areas 45-90 minutes comprehensive treatment plan for extended appointment. Downtime is ZERO - immediately after shows redness similar to mild sunburn lasting 1-4 hours, possible slight swelling around follicles, treated area may feel warm, looks like you just shaved with no visible hair. Days 1-3 any redness resolved and skin may feel slightly sensitive and treated hair still in follicles will shed soon. Days 7-14 hair begins shedding peppering out, gentle exfoliation helps release hair, skin becomes progressively smoother, and hair-free period begins. Weeks 3-6 smooth hair-free skin, new growth from dormant follicles may appear, ready for next treatment. Return to normal activities immediately, return to exercise 24 hours avoid excessive sweating immediately after, makeup or deodorant can apply after treatment area cools. Results timeline shows after each session progressive hair reduction, Full series 6-8 sessions gives 80-90% permanent reduction, and Maintenance 1-2 sessions per year if needed. Recommended treatment plan is typical series of 6-8 sessions for optimal results, session spacing 4-8 weeks apart depends on area and hair growth, and maintenance 1-2 sessions yearly if needed. Aftercare first 24 hours avoid hot showers saunas hot tubs steam rooms, no excessive sweating or intense exercise, apply aloe or cooling gel if skin feels warm, no sun exposure, no deodorant for 24 hours if underarms treated, avoid tight clothing on treated areas. First week wear SPF 30+ on treated areas if exposed to sun, avoid tanning beds completely, no waxing plucking or threading but shaving is OK, gentle exfoliation after 5-7 days to help hair shed, use fragrance-free products on sensitive areas. Between sessions shave only DO NOT wax pluck or thread as waxing removes hair follicles needed for laser targeting, exfoliate gently to release shedding hair, moisturize treated areas, continue sun protection. Avoid if you have very light blonde red or gray hair won't respond well, active skin infections or open wounds, recent sun exposure or active tan increases burn risk, history of keloid scarring in treatment area, or uncontrolled diabetes affects healing. It provides permanent REDUCTION not always 100% permanent REMOVAL - most people see 80-90% permanent hair loss with fine light regrowth may occur but is minimal and easily managed, some may need occasional maintenance sessions. Hair grows in three phases anagen growing catagen transitional and telogen resting - laser only works on actively growing hair anagen and at any time only 20-30% of your hair is in this phase so multiple treatments are needed to catch all follicles. Unfortunately laser hair removal doesn't work well on light blonde red or gray hair because they lack enough melanin to absorb the laser energy - it works best on dark hair. Modern lasers can be adjusted for different skin tones and darker skin requires specialized settings to avoid burns - we customize treatment for your specific skin type."

    "title": "De|Rive Hair Restoration - PRP Therapy",
    "content": "De|Rive Hair Restoration uses the innovative Aquafirme technology combined with Platelet-Rich Plasma PRP therapy to deliver powerful growth factors directly to the scalp.

Pricing is $400 per session. Recommended treatment plan is initial series of 3-6 treatments for optimal results, session spacing monthly every 4-6 weeks, maintenance every 6-12 months after initial series, and results visible after 3-6 treatments taking 3-6 months. Multiple sessions are needed because hair growth cycles take time and consistent treatments provide cumulative benefits, progressively activating more follicles and improving results with each session. It treats thinning hair and hair loss, androgenic alopecia male and female pattern baldness, receding hairline, widening part, overall hair density loss, weak brittle hair, and poor scalp health. Ideal for adults experiencing thinning hair or hair loss, men with male pattern baldness early to moderate, women with female pattern hair loss, people with overall hair thinning or density loss, those seeking natural non-surgical solutions, anyone wanting to improve hair quality and thickness, and people committed to a treatment series.

What to expect during treatment is blood draw similar to routine blood test, scalp may be numbed for comfort, Aquafirme delivery feels like gentle massage or pressure, generally well-tolerated, and relaxing experience overall. Downtime is MINIMAL - immediately after shows slight scalp tenderness or sensitivity, possible mild redness on scalp, no visible signs in most cases, can return to normal activities. First 24-48 hours avoid washing hair for 24 hours, mild scalp sensitivity if any, no visible appearance changes, resume most normal activities.

After initial series of 3-6 treatments clients notice reduced hair shedding, new baby hairs growing in thinning areas, improved hair thickness and quality, stronger healthier-looking hair, better scalp health, increased hair density over time, and slower progression of hair loss. At 6+ months shows noticeable regrowth in thinning areas, fuller-looking hair overall, improved hairline definition, thicker individual hair strands, enhanced volume and coverage, and better styling capability. It does NOT regrow hair on completely bald areas with no follicles left, work overnight as patience required with 3-6 months for visible results, replace hair transplant surgery for advanced loss, stop hair loss completely forever as maintenance needed, or guarantee specific amount of regrowth. Results vary significantly between individuals with some seeing dramatic improvement and others seeing modest gains so managing expectations is crucial. Aftercare first 24 hours don't wash hair, avoid touching or scratching scalp, no vigorous exercise or sweating, no swimming or soaking hair, avoid direct sun exposure on scalp, no hair products styling products or treatments. Days 2-3 resume gentle shampooing, avoid harsh hair treatments, continue avoiding vigorous exercise, protect scalp from sun.

To maximize results complete recommended series don't skip sessions, follow all aftercare instructions, maintain consistent treatment schedule, use quality hair care products, address underlying health issues affecting hair, consider combining with minoxidil or other treatments ask provider, schedule maintenance treatments as recommended. Avoid if you have active scalp infections or skin conditions, blood disorders or clotting abnormalities, cancer or undergoing chemotherapy, uncontrolled diabetes, platelet dysfunction syndromes, chronic liver disease, or severe anemia. Not ideal for complete baldness with no follicles left to stimulate, very advanced hair loss may need transplant, hair loss from scarring alopecia, or those seeking instant results. Most people achieve desired results with 1 treatment and some may choose a second session 3-6 months later for additional improvement with results typically lasting 2-3+ years. Best results are seen in early to moderate hair loss with active follicles still present and it's less effective for completely bald areas where follicles are gone."

    "slug": "faqs-general",
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "content": "Do you offer free consultations? Yes, complimentary consultations are available for all treatments. This allows our providers to assess your needs, discuss options, and create a personalized treatment plan. How can I book an appointment? You can book online at harmonyaestheticsandwellness.glossgenius.com, by phone at (240) 280-0020, by text at (240) 280-0020, or in person at either location. Do I need to pay a deposit? No deposit is required when booking online. Do you offer package deals or memberships? Yes, package pricing is offered for many treatments. We also have options for treatment series at discounted rates. Ask about current packages during your consultation or when booking. Which facial is right for me? We will recommend the best option based on your skin type and concerns during your consultation. Generally, Aquafirme is great for immediate glow and deep cleansing, Osmosis is perfect for sensitive skin and holistic health, and Dermaplaning provides instant smoothness. What's the difference between Signature and Deluxe facials? Signature facials are results-driven and efficient, perfect for maintenance or busy schedules. Deluxe facials include added enhancements like advanced exfoliation, specialized masks, extra relaxation time, and targeted treatments - ideal for special occasions or when you want comprehensive pampering. Can I get a facial with sensitive skin? Yes, facials are customized for all skin types. Osmosis facials are particularly excellent for sensitive, reactive, or rosacea-prone skin. What's the difference between Scarlet RF and Agnes RF? Scarlet RF focuses on overall skin tightening, texture improvement, and scarring across larger areas like face, neck, and chest. Agnes RF targets specific fat deposits and precision tightening in smaller areas like under the eyes and jowls. Many clients benefit from both depending on their concerns. How many RF microneedling sessions do I need? Many see results after one session, but most benefit from a series of 3 spaced treatments for optimal, long-lasting results with Scarlet RF. Agnes RF typically requires 1-2 treatments per area. What's the downtime for RF microneedling? Scarlet RF has 3-5 days of visible redness and mild swelling. Agnes RF has 3-7 days depending on the area treated, with eye treatments potentially having more swelling initially. What is IPL and what does it treat? IPL is Intense Pulsed Light therapy that treats sun damage, pigmentation, rosacea, melasma, broken capillaries, and uneven skin tone using broad-spectrum light energy. Does IPL hurt? Most describe it as a light snap or rubber band flick. Discomfort is minimal and we use cooling technology to improve comfort. How many IPL treatments do I need? Usually 3-5 sessions spaced 3-4 weeks apart for best results. What's the difference between VI Peel and PRX? VI Peel exfoliates visibly with 3-7 days of peeling, great for pigmentation and dramatic results. PRX stimulates collagen without visible peeling or downtime, perfect for tightening and glow. Many clients do both for different benefits. What's the difference between Botox and fillers? Botox relaxes muscles to smooth wrinkles caused by movement like forehead lines and crow's feet. Fillers add volume to fill in lines, plump lips, or restore facial contours. They address different concerns and many people use both. Will I look frozen or unnatural with Botox? Not when done by skilled injectors! Our goal is natural-looking results where you still have facial expression and movement, just with smoother skin. Will I look overdone with fillers? Not with our conservative, natural approach! We aim for enhancement that looks like you, but refreshed. You can always add more at follow-up if desired. Is laser hair removal permanent? It provides permanent REDUCTION, typically 80-90% permanent hair loss. Fine, light regrowth may occur but is minimal. Some people need occasional maintenance sessions. How many laser hair removal sessions will I need? Typically 6-8 sessions spaced 4-8 weeks apart depending on the area, because hair grows in cycles and laser only works on actively growing hair. Does laser hair removal work on all hair colors? It works best on dark hair. Light, blonde, red, or gray hair doesn't respond well because it lacks enough melanin pigment to absorb the laser energy. When will I see results from PRP hair restoration? Most notice reduced shedding and thicker hair around 2-3 months. Visible regrowth and density improvement typically appears at 3-6 months, with maximum results at 6-12 months after completing the initial series."

    "title": "Botox, Daxxify & Xeomin - Neurotoxin Injectables",
    "content": "Botox, Daxxify, and Xeomin are neurotoxin injectables (neuromodulators) that temporarily relax facial muscles to smooth wrinkles and prevent new lines from forming. They work by blocking signals from nerves to muscles, causing relaxed muscles which creates a smoother skin surface. Results are temporary and require maintenance. Botox costs $16 per unit and lasts 3-4 months on average - it's the most well-known brand with decades of proven use. Daxxify costs $12 per unit and may last up to 6 months for some patients - it's a newer formulation with peptide-based stabilizer. Xeomin costs $12 per unit and lasts 3-4 months - it's a naked neurotoxin without accessory proteins that may reduce risk of antibody resistance. Typical units needed are 10-20 units for forehead ($160-320 with Botox), 15-25 units for frown lines ($240-400 with Botox), 10-15 units per side for crow's feet, and 40-60 units for full upper face ($640-960 with Botox). Common treatment areas include forehead lines, frown lines between eyebrows (11s), crow's feet around eyes, bunny lines on nose, lip flip, chin dimpling, and neck bands. The treatment session takes 15-30 minutes total. Downtime is minimal to none - small bumps at injection sites resolve in 20-30 minutes, possible mild bruising is rare, clients can return to normal activities immediately but should wait 24 hours for exercise. Results appear in 3-5 days with full results visible at 10-14 days, lasting 3-6 months depending on the product. Aftercare includes staying upright for 4 hours, avoiding touching or rubbing treated areas, no strenuous exercise for 24 hours, avoiding excessive heat like saunas or hot yoga for 24 hours, no alcohol for 24 hours, and no facials or facial treatments for 24 hours. People should avoid these treatments if pregnant, breastfeeding, have neuromuscular disorders like myasthenia gravis or ALS, are allergic to botulinum toxin, or have active infection at injection site. When done by skilled injectors, results look natural with facial expression and movement maintained - the frozen look only happens with excessive dosing or inexperienced injectors. Most clients return every 3-4 months to maintain results."

    "slug": "dermal-fillers",
    "title": "Dermal Fillers - Juvederm & RHA",
    "content": "Dermal fillers are injectable gel-based products made from hyaluronic acid that restore volume, smooth lines, and enhance facial contours. Unlike neurotoxins like Botox that relax muscles, fillers physically fill in wrinkles and add volume where needed. Hyaluronic acid attracts and holds moisture up to 1000 times its weight in water, adds instant volume to treated areas, and stimulates natural collagen production over time with immediate results that improve over 2 weeks. Juvederm fillers start at $800 per syringe and include Voluma for cheeks and mid-face volume, Vollure for moderate to severe facial wrinkles, Volbella for lips and fine lines around mouth, and Ultra which is versatile for lips and facial lines. RHA (Resilient Hyaluronic Acid) fillers start at $700 per syringe, are newer technology designed to mimic natural HA in skin, more flexible and adapt to facial movement, ideal for dynamic areas like around mouth and smile lines, and come in three densities RHA 2, RHA 3, and RHA 4 with increasing volume and depth. Typical syringes needed are 1-2 for lips ($700-1600), 1-2 for nasolabial folds ($700-1600), 1 per side for marionette lines, 1-2 per side for cheeks ($1400-3200 total), 1 syringe total for under eyes, 2-4 for jawline ($1400-3200), and 4-8 for full face rejuvenation ($2800-6400). Common treatment areas include lips to add volume and define borders, cheeks to restore volume and lift mid-face, nasolabial folds to smooth smile lines, marionette lines from mouth to chin, under eyes to reduce hollow dark appearance, jawline to define and contour, chin to add projection, temples to restore volume, and hands for rejuvenation. Session length is 30-60 minutes including numbing cream application for 10-15 minutes. Downtime is minimal but more than neurotoxins - moderate swelling for 24-48 hours especially for lip fillers with most swelling subsiding in 48 hours, possible bruising, slight asymmetry as product settles in first week, residual swelling decreasing gradually, and results continuing to refine as product integrates. For social events, plan treatments 1-2 weeks before to allow swelling to fully resolve. Results show immediate visible volume with final results at 2 weeks after swelling resolves, lasting 6-18 months depending on product and area - lips last 6-12 months, nasolabial folds and marionette lines 9-12 months, cheeks and under eyes 12-18 months. Aftercare includes applying ice packs first 24 hours, sleeping elevated with 2 pillows, avoiding touching pressing or massaging treated areas, no strenuous exercise for 24-48 hours, no alcohol for 24 hours, avoiding excessive heat, and for lip fillers specifically avoiding puckering kissing or using straws for 24-48 hours. Avoid if pregnant, breastfeeding, have active skin infection or inflammation, are allergic to hyaluronic acid or lidocaine, have bleeding disorders, or history of severe allergic reactions. The difference from Botox is that Botox relaxes muscles to smooth dynamic wrinkles while fillers add volume to fill static wrinkles and enhance features - many people use both for comprehensive facial rejuvenation."

    "content": "Dermaplaning is a manual exfoliation technique that uses a sterile surgical scalpel to gently remove dead skin cells and vellus hair known as peach fuzz from the face. It's a non-invasive treatment that reveals smoother, brighter skin instantly with zero downtime. A trained esthetician uses a precision blade at a 45-degree angle to remove the top layer of dead skin and fine facial hair, revealing fresh healthy skin underneath, creating a smooth canvas for makeup and skincare, and stimulating cell turnover. The Signature Dermaplane Facial costs $100, takes 45-60 minutes, and includes double cleanse, dermaplaning of full face, customized mask treatment, hydrating serums, moisturizer and SPF - it's a complete treatment with maximum benefits. The Dermaplane Add-on costs $50 and can be added to another facial treatment like Osmosis or Aquafirme - it enhances results of your chosen facial and allows products to penetrate deeper. It treats dull rough skin texture, fine vellus hair peach fuzz, dry flaky skin, uneven skin tone, clogged pores, fine lines and wrinkles, and mild acne scarring. Ideal for anyone wanting instantly smoother skin, people with dull rough texture, those bothered by peach fuzz, clients wanting better makeup application, anyone seeking non-chemical exfoliation, people preparing for special events, those wanting to boost skincare product effectiveness, all skin types with some exceptions, and great for dry flaky skin, fine facial hair, uneven texture, and mature skin. Avoid dermaplaning if you have active acne breakouts or cystic acne, active cold sores or herpes outbreak, inflamed or sunburned skin, open wounds cuts or abrasions, severe rosacea or eczema flare-up, or recent Accutane use within 6 months. Postpone if you recently had laser treatments - wait 2-4 weeks, just had chemical peels - wait 2 weeks, have uncontrolled diabetes, or are on blood thinners. A critical myth to address - hair will NOT grow back thicker or darker, this is completely false - vellus hair peach fuzz will grow back the same texture and color. Safe for most skin tones including darker skin as it doesn't cause hyperpigmentation like some treatments. There is ZERO downtime - skin is instantly smooth and glowing immediately with possible slight pinkness that fades within 1-2 hours, skin may feel slightly tight which is normal, peach fuzz and dead skin completely removed, clients can return to all normal activities immediately, apply makeup but may not need it as skin will be photo-ready instantly, and go to work or events. Results last 3-4 weeks before vellus hair regrows. Aftercare for first 24-48 hours is critical and includes wearing SPF 30+ and reapplying every 2 hours if outdoors, avoiding direct sun exposure when possible, no tanning beds or excessive heat, don't touch face with dirty hands, use only clean makeup brushes, and avoid swimming pools or hot tubs. First 3-5 days avoid harsh exfoliants like AHAs BHAs retinoids or scrubs, use gentle hydrating products, no other exfoliating treatments, and avoid saunas and steam rooms. To maximize results apply serums immediately after treatment as absorption is 5x better, use high-quality skincare products, schedule treatments every 3-4 weeks, protect skin from sun damage, and stay hydrated. Schedule next treatment every 3-4 weeks for optimal results, time with hair regrowth cycle, or before special events 2-7 days prior."

    "title": "Agnes RF Microneedling",
    "content": "Agnes RF is a precision radiofrequency microneedling treatment specifically designed to target stubborn fat deposits and provide focused tightening in delicate areas like around the eyes and lower face. Unlike traditional RF microneedling that treats broader areas, Agnes delivers targeted energy to very specific problem zones for dramatic, localized results. Ultra-fine insulated microneedles deliver RF energy to precise depths, target fat cells and stimulate collagen in specific areas, permanently reduce fat pockets through controlled heating, tighten skin with minimal surface damage, and provide precision treatment for areas other technologies can't safely address.

Day 0 immediately after shows significant swelling especially eyes, redness and warmth, small marks where needles entered, and possible minor bruising. Days 1-3 for eyes shows moderate to severe swelling worst on day 2, for lower face jowls shows moderate swelling, redness decreasing, possible bruising developing, and skin feels tight. Days 4-7 swelling significantly reduced, minor residual puffiness, bruising fading if present, can typically return to social activities, and makeup helps cover any remaining marks. Days 7-14 most visible signs resolved, full social activities resume. Return to work 3-5 days can be longer for eye treatments, return to exercise 5-7 days, return to full social calendar 7-10 days. Results timeline shows Weeks 2-4 swelling fully resolves with initial results visible, Months 1-3 progressive tightening and fat reduction, Months 3-6 peak results as collagen remodels, and Duration 2-3+ years with results often permanent for fat reduction.

    "title": "Chemical Peels and PRX-T33 Collagen Stimulator",
    "content": "Chemical peels and PRX-T33 are advanced skin rejuvenation treatments that use specialized formulations to improve skin texture, tone, and appearance. While both deliver impressive results, they work differently and suit different needs. VI Peel is a medical-grade chemical peel that exfoliates the top layers of skin to reveal fresher healthier skin underneath. PRX-T33 Collagen Stimulator is an innovative no-peel peel that stimulates collagen deep in the skin without visible peeling or downtime. VI Peel costs $300 and is a medical-grade chemical peel formulation containing a synergistic blend of acids TCA salicylic acid retinoic acid phenol and vitamin C that penetrates skin to treat acne, sun damage, melasma, fine lines, and uneven texture, suitable for all skin types and tones. The acid solution is applied to clean skin, penetrates to controlled depth, triggers exfoliation and cell turnover, dead skin peels off over 3-7 days, reveals fresh rejuvenated skin, and stimulates collagen production. It treats sun damage and age spots, melasma and hyperpigmentation, acne and acne scars, fine lines and wrinkles, uneven texture and tone, large pores, and dull aging skin. Recommended plan is series of 3-6 peels spaced 4-6 weeks apart for optimal results. PRX-T33 Collagen Stimulator Series costs $1200 and is a revolutionary bio-revitalization treatment that combines high-concentration TCA with hydrogen peroxide and kojic acid. Unlike traditional peels, it stimulates collagen production WITHOUT causing visible peeling, making it perfect for those who want results without downtime. The medical-grade solution is massaged into skin, penetrates deeply to stimulate fibroblasts, triggers immediate collagen and elastin production, hydrogen peroxide allows deep penetration without frosting, skin tightens and rejuvenates from within, and no actual peeling occurs though skin may shed microscopically. It treats fine lines and wrinkles, skin laxity and sagging, uneven texture, dull tired-looking skin, loss of elasticity, stretch marks on body, acne scars, and provides overall skin rejuvenation. Pricing is $1200 for series which typically includes 4-6 treatments spaced 1-2 weeks apart. The difference is choose VI Peel if you want visible exfoliation and peeling, treatment for pigmentation or melasma, acne and acne scar improvement, don't mind 3-7 days of peeling downtime, and dramatic results after one treatment. Choose PRX-T33 if you want no visible peeling or downtime, collagen stimulation and tightening, glow and radiance without shedding skin, can't take time off for peeling, and gradual cumulative improvement. Many clients do both - VI Peel for specific concerns and PRX for ongoing collagen maintenance. VI Peel downtime is Days 1-2 skin looks slightly red or tan with mild tightness and no visible peeling yet and makeup can cover redness, Days 3-5 visible peeling begins with skin shedding in sheets especially around mouth and eyes and can look flaky and unsightly - this is when you need social downtime, Days 6-7 most peeling complete revealing fresh glowing skin and can return to normal activities with makeup application normal, Days 7-10 peeling fully complete with dramatic improvement visible and skin looks refreshed and rejuvenated. PRX-T33 downtime is immediately after slightly pink or flushed lasting 1-2 hours with skin feeling tighter and smoother and visible glow, Days 1-7 no visible peeling though microscopic shedding occurs with progressively smoother texture and increasing radiance and can wear makeup immediately and return to all activities same day - ZERO social downtime. VI Peel aftercare first 48 hours don't wash face or get peel wet, no sweating or exercise, sleep on clean pillowcase, don't touch or pick at skin. During peeling days 3-7 let skin peel naturally DON'T pick, use provided post-peel products only, gentle cleansing when allowed, no makeup until peeling complete or light mineral makeup, wear SPF 30+ religiously, no sun exposure. After peeling complete continue sun protection, resume normal skincare gradually, avoid harsh products for 2 weeks, stay hydrated. PRX-T33 aftercare first 24 hours don't wash face for 6-8 hours, no sweating or exercise same day, can apply makeup after 6-8 hours. Ongoing wear SPF 30+ daily, use gentle skincare, stay hydrated, avoid harsh exfoliants between treatments - much easier than traditional peels. Avoid chemical peels if you have active skin infections or cold sores, open wounds or abrasions, recently used Accutane wait 6 months, severe eczema or psoriasis, allergy to peel ingredients, or recent facial surgery. Avoid PRX-T33 if you have active skin infections, very sensitive skin with rosacea flare-up, allergy to treatment components, or recent laser or peel treatments wait 2 weeks. Both are safe for all skin tones Fitzpatrick I-VI when performed properly and VI Peel was specifically designed to be safe for ethnic skin."
